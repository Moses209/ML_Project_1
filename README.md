# Project Topic: Crop Recommendation Dataset For Prediction Modeling.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project focused on data wrangling, model development, model prediction outcome, and to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on several agro-climatic parameters. It is typically used in precision agriculture and machine learning applications aimed at supporting farmers, agricultural advisors, and policymakers. 
# Project Overview

This dataset is structured to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on several agro-climatic parameters. It is typically used in precision agriculture and machine learning applications aimed at supporting farmers, agricultural advisors, and policymakers.
